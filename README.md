# Victims of Police Violence

I am heart-broken at the death of George Floyd and angry at the clear systemic racism in this country. I didn't know exactly what to do, as the overwhelming barrage of people telling others to post, retweet, sign, donate, protest more made me unsure of every action I thought I should be doing.

As a data-scientist, I looked at this from a data perspective. With the help of other crowd-sourced databases, like Washington Posts' [Chicago Police Data Github](https://github.com/invinst/chicago-police-data/blob/master/data/unified_data/unified_data.zip), [Killed by Police](http://killedbypolice.net/), I webscraped and compiled together a growing dataset of victims of police violence. 

Please feel free to use this data as you please - I will begin doing some basic EDA maybe a little ML once finals are over.
